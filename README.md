# Networking

The socket programming application was programed using python 3.9.9. the code could be run on an interpreter or even on a terminal. In order for the code to work the server file must be run first then the client. The application contains multi-threading which means that the server can connect and respond to multiple clients. To run the code from the terminal, open the terminal inside the folder containing the files by writing cmd in the file directory.   
 
Write “python TCP_server.py” and press enter, then open another terminal and do the same but write TCP_client.py server instead. The client file could be used more than once to represent multiple clients connecting to the server. When the client file runs there will be a -> for the user to write their message to the server, and the server will have all the information of the connected client (the port number, client’s IP address, protocol used, application to monitor and the device’s mac address).
